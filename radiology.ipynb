Bibasilar atelectasis has nearly resolved\\nwith residual patchy atelectasis remaining in the right lower lobe and only\\nminimal residual linear atelectasis in the left lower lobe.  Apparent\\nrightward deviation of the trachea is likely due to mild patient rotation and\\ncurvature of the spine, as there is no evidence of a discrete paratracheal\\nmass on recent neck CTA of ___.

       "      <td>DATE OF SERVICE:  ___.\\n\\nPRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left occipital hemorrhage.\\n\\nINDICATION:  Rule out vascular malformation.\\n\\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  ___, M.D.\\n\\nASSISTANT:  ___, N.P.\\n\\nANESTHESIA:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of\\nfentanyl and Versed throughout the total intraservice time of 45 minutes,\\nduring which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored.\\n\\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED:  Right internal carotid artery arteriogram, right\\nexternal carotid artery arteriogram, left internal carotid artery arteriogram,\\nleft external carotid artery arteriogram, left vertebral artery arteriogram,\\nright common femoral artery arteriogram and Angio-Seal closure of right common\\nfemoral artery puncture site.\\n\\nDETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite. \\nIV sedation was given.  Following this, both groins were prepped and draped in\\na sterile fashion.  Access was gained to the right common femoral artery and a\\n5 ___ vascular sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery.  We\\nnow catheterized the above-mentioned vessels and AP, lateral filming was done.\\nThis did not show evidence of brain aneurysm.  At this point, the right common\\nfemoral artery arteriogram was done and a 6 ___ Angio-Seal was used for\\nclosure of the right common femoral artery puncture site.\\n\\nFINDINGS:  Right internal carotid artery arteriogram shows filling of the\\nright internal carotid artery along the cervical, petrous, cavernous, and\\nsupraclinoid portion.  The anterior and middle cerebral arteries fill well. \\nThe PCA is seen to be fetal in origin.  There is a vascular blush in the\\nlateral aspect of the orbit; however, there is no evidence of a dural AV\\nfistula.  The ophthalmic artery is also seen to give rise to a large branch\\nwhich seems to course superiorly through the superior orbital fissure most\\nlikely anastomosing with the middle meningeal artery. \\n\\n Right external carotid artery arteriogram shows no evidence of dural AV\\nfistula.\\n\\nLeft internal carotid artery arteriogram shows filling of the left internal\\ncarotid artery along the cervical, petrous, cavernous, and supraclinoid\\nportion.  The anterior and middle middle cerebral arteries are seen normally\\nwith no evidence of arteriovenous malformation or dural AV fistula.  There is\\na prominent posterior communicating artery; however, this is not fetal in\\nnature.\\n\\nLeft external carotid artery arteriogram shows no evidence of dural AV\\nfistula.\\n\\nLeft vertebral artery arteriogram shows filling of the left vertebral artery\\nwith reflux into the right vertebral artery.  The left PCA is seen; however,\\nthe right PCA is not seen because of the hypoplastic nature of the right P1. \\nThe superior cerebellar arteries are seen well.  There is mass effect on the\\ndistal branches of the left PCA; however, there is no definite evidence of an\\narteriovenous malformation.  One cortical vein draining into the superior\\nsagittal sinus is seen early, but there is no definite evidence of a nidus.\\n\\nRight common femoral artery arteriogram shows widely patent right common\\nfemoral artery.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  ___ underwent cerebral angiography which failed to\\nreveal a source of hemorrhage in the left occipital lobe.  There was a vein\\nwhich appeared slightly early in the left vertebral artery injection draining\\ninto the left superior sagittal sinus; however, this was not consistent with\\nan AVM and angiogram should be repeated in a month's time after the mass\\neffect from the hematoma has resolved.\\n</td>\n",

Assess for intracranial\\nprocess.\\n\\nCOMPARISON:  Outside CT head on ___.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast MDCT images were acquired through the head. \\nFollowing IV administration of iodinated contrast, MDCT images were acquired\\nfrom the aortic arch to the vertex per CTA head and neck protocol.  Dedicated\\n3D rendering was performed to better assess the underlying vasculature:\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\n\\nNON-CONTRAST CT HEAD:  There is a 3.9 x 2.2 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage in\\nthe left occipital lobe.  There is mild ___ edema.  No\\nsignificant interval changes are noted compared to the outside study\\napproximately 7 hours prior.  There is no new hemorrhagic focus.  The\\nventricles remain normal and symmetric in size.  There is no intraventricular\\nhemorrhagic extension.  There is no shift of normally midline structures. \\nThere is no evidence of acute skull fracture.  There is a small amount of\\nretained fluid in the posterior nasal passage, in keeping with patient's\\nintubation status.  The mastoid air cells are clear.\\n\\nCTA NECK:  There is a normal three-vessel aortic arch.  Major cervical vessels\\nand great mediastinal vessels are patent.  There is no significant ICA\\nstenosis by NASCET criteria.  There is no evidence of aneurysm, dissection, or\\nocclusion.  The visualized lung apices are noted with minimal dependent\\natelectasis, but otherwise unremarkable.  The thyroid gland is normal.  Major\\ncervical musculature is symmetric.  The parotid glands and submandibular\\nglands are normal and symmetric.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Multilevel\\ndegenerative changes are moderate in the visualized cervicothoracic spine.\\n\\nCTA HEAD:  Major intracranial vessels are patent.  There is no evidence of\\naneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or occlusion.  A hypoplastic right P1\\nsegment is noted with a robust right posterior communicating artery,\\nrepresenting a fetal-type right PCA.

Diffusion-weighted images and ADC maps were also obtained for\\nevaluation.\\n\\nFINDINGS:  Again noted is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered at the\\nleft occipital lobe.  There is ___ edema with moderate mass\\neffect on to the adjacent parenchyma.  No shift of normally midline structures\\nis noted.  There is no definite evidence of intraventricular hemorrhagic\\nextension.

Major vascular\\nflow voids are present.  There is no slow diffusion to suggest acute\\ninfarction.\\n\\nThere is moderate amount of retained fluid in the right mastoid air cells. \\nThe remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and left mastoid air cells are\\nclear.

No midline shift or\\nintraventricular hemorrhagic extension.  No acute infarcts or definite\\npostcontrast enhancement.\\n\\n2.  A small DVA traversing in the vicinity of the left occipital\\nintraparenchymal hemorrhage.  The presence of a nearby DVA favors the\\ndifferential of cavernous malformation (hemangioma cavernoma) which\\nhemorrhaged.\\n\\n3.

       "2321354  DATE OF SERVICE:  ___.\\n\\nPRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left occipital hemorrhage.\\n\\nINDICATION:  Rule out vascular malformation.\\n\\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  ___, M.D.\\n\\nASSISTANT:  ___, N.P.\\n\\nANESTHESIA:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of\\nfentanyl and Versed throughout the total intraservice time of 45 minutes,\\nduring which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored.\\n\\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED:  Right internal carotid artery arteriogram, right\\nexternal carotid artery arteriogram, left internal carotid artery arteriogram,\\nleft external carotid artery arteriogram, left vertebral artery arteriogram,\\nright common femoral artery arteriogram and Angio-Seal closure of right common\\nfemoral artery puncture site.\\n\\nDETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite. \\nIV sedation was given.  Following this, both groins were prepped and draped in\\na sterile fashion.  Access was gained to the right common femoral artery and a\\n5 ___ vascular sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery.  We\\nnow catheterized the above-mentioned vessels and AP, lateral filming was done.\\nThis did not show evidence of brain aneurysm.  At this point, the right common\\nfemoral artery arteriogram was done and a 6 ___ Angio-Seal was used for\\nclosure of the right common femoral artery puncture site.\\n\\nFINDINGS:  Right internal carotid artery arteriogram shows filling of the\\nright internal carotid artery along the cervical, petrous, cavernous, and\\nsupraclinoid portion.  The anterior and middle cerebral arteries fill well. \\nThe PCA is seen to be fetal in origin.  There is a vascular blush in the\\nlateral aspect of the orbit; however, there is no evidence of a dural AV\\nfistula.  The ophthalmic artery is also seen to give rise to a large branch\\nwhich seems to course superiorly through the superior orbital fissure most\\nlikely anastomosing with the middle meningeal artery. \\n\\n Right external carotid artery arteriogram shows no evidence of dural AV\\nfistula.\\n\\nLeft internal carotid artery arteriogram shows filling of the left internal\\ncarotid artery along the cervical, petrous, cavernous, and supraclinoid\\nportion.  The anterior and middle middle cerebral arteries are seen normally\\nwith no evidence of arteriovenous malformation or dural AV fistula.  There is\\na prominent posterior communicating artery; however, this is not fetal in\\nnature.\\n\\nLeft external carotid artery arteriogram shows no evidence of dural AV\\nfistula.\\n\\nLeft vertebral artery arteriogram shows filling of the left vertebral artery\\nwith reflux into the right vertebral artery.  The left PCA is seen; however,\\nthe right PCA is not seen because of the hypoplastic nature of the right P1. \\nThe superior cerebellar arteries are seen well.  There is mass effect on the\\ndistal branches of the left PCA; however, there is no definite evidence of an\\narteriovenous malformation.  One cortical vein draining into the superior\\nsagittal sinus is seen early, but there is no definite evidence of a nidus.\\n\\nRight common femoral artery arteriogram shows widely patent right common\\nfemoral artery.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  ___ underwent cerebral angiography which failed to\\nreveal a source of hemorrhage in the left occipital lobe.  There was a vein\\nwhich appeared slightly early in the left vertebral artery injection draining\\ninto the left superior sagittal sinus; however, this was not consistent with\\nan AVM and angiogram should be repeated in a month's time after the mass\\neffect from the hematoma has resolved.\\n  \n",
